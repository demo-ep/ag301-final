Draft Notes:

White Earth Nation has began the process of returning the land back to tribal members by 2029.

The U.S. government paved the way for timber companies to harvest the land in the early 20th century.

Warren Moorehead, a lead investigator for White Earth Nation, noted that during this time, buyers commited over 1200 instances of fraud to obtain the land.

This dwindled land that was once available to the nation from over 800,000 acres to a mere 800 acres.

Barry Nelson, the Becker County commissioner, still believes that land should be something you can pay for. He states that further information is needed to prove that a balance is owed on the land that has yet to be paid.

The surrounding counties: Becker, Mahnomen, and Clearwater, all oppose the return of White Earth Nation Forest Land to the White Earth Nation.

These counties have hired lobbyists to fight against the return of the land, stating that the return would hurt the local economy. Their economy consists of tourism, hunting, and local logging.

While local businessmen such as Craig Hall are concerned about whether the return of the land to the White Earth Nation caretakers would restrict his ability to snowmobile on the trails, the original people simply want to revive a healthy culture that is not driven by greed.
