Week 3 notes

Thoughts about the video: "Teachings of the Tree people and tending the wild."

All teaching is hands on which establishes a natural connection with resources
around.

This method of teaching was cut off when some elders decided to help the youth
survive in the coming new world.

The creation of baskets seemed less about the end product and more about bringing
people together, share knowledge, and strengthen the community. 

Contrasting to today, where everything we see is about the end goal, with the
idea of a 'community' seemingly dissappearing.

When a community begins to degrade, slowly but surely, everything around that
fading community begins to become poisoned.
